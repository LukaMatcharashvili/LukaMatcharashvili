Experienced Middle SDE

Greetings! I am an experienced Middle SDE with close to 1 year of professional experience, currently contributing my skills and knowledge at Ozorix as a Middle SDE. My expertise lies in software development, where I have honed my skills in a wide range of technologies, including Scala, AWS, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB,  Node.js, HTML5, CSS, Angular.

I possess strong proficiency in using Linux as a developer, Docker for containerization, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and Git for efficient version control. I'm currently trying to learn Functional Programming (FP), exploring languages like Haskell. My curiosity extends to low-level programming and I'm actively learning C to deepen my understanding of the intricate workings beneath the surface.

During my time at Ozorix, I have contributed to various projects that have showcased my skills and versatility. These include:

1. The Siemens System Builder: A powerful tool designed to assist engineers in the process of building a fire safety system equipment list.

2. Fleet Management System: I contributed to the development of a sophisticated system leveraging AWS IoT, enabling efficient management and monitoring of fleets.

3. Food Delivery Software: I actively worked on order processing and price calculation logic.

4. CMS for Real Estate Website.
